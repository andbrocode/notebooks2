# the files are named as follows:

Mag80 = Magnitude 8.0

200km = at a distance of 200 km

# Data in file:

Frequency	acceleration	rotation rate

# Calculation of rotation rate:
Freq. [Hz]      Mean velocity. [m/s]    Incremental velocity.	Rotation rate. [rad/s]
0.01 - 1	3000			v(f) = -1515f+3015	acc/v
1.1 - 10	1500			v(f) = -122f+1622
10.1 - 80	402			402
